### What Is PlayEarnGame ($PEG)?

PlayEarnGame is DAO with a gaming eCommerce website where you can buy games from the major platforms and earn $PEG tokens by playing video games. Thanks to the integration of the $PEG token the platform is able to create engagement with users providing a Play to Earn protocol on every Steam game. The project aims to develop integrations with more platforms but without the use of downloadable apps.

$PEG is the native utility token that is used for:

* Rewarding users for using Play to Earn protocol
* Creating and voting polls to make community decisions about the Project
* Buying games on PlayEarnGame.com
* Being an asset
* Being a share of the project.

### What Makes PlayEarnGame Unique?

Unlike other competitors PlayEarnGame offers its Play to Earn protocol not on its own game but on every game on the Steam platform without the use of any downloadable software. The number of supported platforms will grow giving more value to the project itself. It also offers: a cashback on already discounted games if they have been bought with $PEG, internal staking functions and a voting protocol..

### How Many $PEG Coins Are There in Circulation?

PlayEarnGame launched its mainnet on December 16, 2021 with 1 billion $PEG tokens created at genesis. 4% of the total supply will be kept by the founding team. 11% will be used as an investment. 20% will be kept as Pla to Earn reward and distribute every time a user withdraws his part. 5% will be used for airdrops of the token. The remaining 60% will be public to the exchange and use. Every time the token will be transferred between addresses the 1% of every transaction amount will be burned and 2% will be collected as tax. The team didnâ€™t forecast any massive burn at first.
